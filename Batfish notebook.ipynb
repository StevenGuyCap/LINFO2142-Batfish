    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of our UCLouvain classes in computer networking: configuration and management (LINFO2142), we were asked to analyze a new tool to describe a network configuration. This tool is Batfish, an informative tool developed to get more insights of a network and validate its deployment. Easily usable by the mean of its python module able to communicate with a docker container running the backend system of batfish, this tool conveys a lot of useful information about the BGP, OSPF and structures used inside our routers with CISCO or CUMULUS configuration formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to explore all the possibilities offered by this application and how it could be concretely deployed for real networks. We will work on a mini-internet configuration made earlier during this academic year by the other students attending the course including ourselves. We had to configure a ten of routers inside an AS by specifying them their IP addresses for each interface, their OSPF configuration and their BGP connections (iBGP and eBGP) to allow inter-ASes communication. This had to be done for IPv4 addresses as well as it could have been done for IPv6.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is targeted to explore the quantity of information provided by the batfish python library. The use of pandas DataFrame embedded in the pybatfish project will be more viewable by the mean of the clear and personalized representation of this jupyter project. We will also try to figure out if such a tool like batfish could be suitable for a kind of automated grading of the configurations made by the students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part will be consecrated to the exploration of the initiation of the sources files, the objects and the parsing of our files. After that, we will discuss the intrinsic structures of the different parts of the networking system and the inner node properties. Then we will focus ourselves to the intra AS networking and the OSPF communication between the router deployed inside an AS. Finally, the BGP point of view of our entire network will be considered. The last part will be a conclusion and a brief overview of the uses of batfish that couldn't have been achieved in our case but worth mentioning.\n",

    "As we will see later one, the next blocks of code won't be able to run if you didn't deploy a docker container containing the batfish image of the system. This process will be used to generate the answers to all the questions we could ask to our configuration (more on this later). The setup of this infrastructure is quite simple. First, you have to download, from docker hub, the image of this container. To do so, you can use the command [<samp>docker pull allinone/batfish</samp>]. After the previous command succeeds, you will be able to use [<samp>docker run --name batfish -v batfish-data:/data -p 8888:8888 -p 9997:9997 -p 9996:9996 batfish/allinone</samp>]. This notebook supposes that you deployed this container before running further cells of code. In order to make the next cells run, you will also have to use [<samp>python3 -m pip install --upgrade pybatfish</samp>] in order to install the necessary packages for the python interpreter. This jupyter project also needs to have access to the pandas module. So, to avoid any kind of error, please be sure the latest version is correcly installed on your computer.\n",

    "> This behaviour wasn't the one we get when we started this project. Indeed, our configuration files weren't either of CISCO format or CUMULUS format leading to a lot of problems to parse the files. The syntax was unrecognized and nothing was answered to the different questions asked to pybatfish. So we took time to do a \"manual\" conversion of each file implied in our network. By the mean of a separate python script, the configurations were translated, one by one, by verifying inside the docs of CUMULUS which instructions are recognized and what are the syntax rules accepted by batfish. After discussion with our professor Olivier Bonaventure, we decided to get rid of the IPv6 part of the mini-internet. This addressing scheme wasn't mandatory and a lot of students did not take the time to do it. So, during the rest of this notebook, only IPv4 will be used to analyze the results.\n",

    "<b>[CAUTION] Configuration type</b>  <br>\n",
    "Take care of the format you use to feed batfish. Be sure to use a correct configuration file respecting the CUMULUS, CISCO or ARISTA formats. Only using files corresponding to your FRRouting configuration won't let you completly use the tool. Even with some syntax errors the complete analysis process could not have been correctly realised and the results could be completly unreadable. During our translation of the different files we encountered a lot of problems. Ths process isn't as easy as we may think because some correct instructions according to the FRRouting documentation, weren't recognized by batfish. For some of them, we didn't find a way to go around them and use an equivalent instruction. So, if batfish was used to grade the config files, some students could have been badly graded even if their system was doing the job. This is one first big limit of this system. So, if you decide to use our translation python script on other configuration files, we don't guarantee a complete and correct translation. All the files used in this notebook were translated correctly, but the huge amount of configuration possibilities doesn't let us cover all the cases.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "For readability, we limited ourselves to this subset of our entire internet network (which was composed of nearly 70 ASes of 8 routers). This will allow us to get results more suitable for exploring the power of batfish. Furthermore, the more we add configurations, the more answering to questions take time. This could be seen as a little inconvenient of batfish: the time needed to answer to some questions, especially the one we could use to do virtual traceroutes. If we want to grade automatically the student, we such have to be sure to have the resources and time to run the questions for the entire network.\n",

    "Surprisingly, or not, batfish found more errors than the number of injected ones. Could it be a flaw in its functionality ? The answer is obviously no. Let's look at the third line of the previous frame. The error is said to be located inside the 29th line, just after the error injected at the 28th line. This is so, also an injected error. By transforming `iface` to `iwace` we led to a second error where the address giving line was orphan of its related interface. So having an address out of nowhere like this in our code, is an error correctly discovered.\n",

Nowadays, most configuration are written thanks to command line and not from scratch inside txt files. When problems like above are typed inside the terminal, the configuration tool is really likely to throw an error itself to say that a syntax is unrecognized. Nonetheless, the capacity of batfish to also detect it was worth mentioning. After all, a corrumption of the information stored for the configurations could always happen and thus leads to these kinds of problems.\n",

    "The first case (L2 interfaces) is quite more understandable when we know the kind of interface they were bound to. Indeed, these structures were used to link our routers named base, zuri and gene to a subnetwork of switches to simulate a datacenter. There were two types of tag involved in this center: 10 and 20 allowing the students to define a virtual network where some hosts could be directly joined without having to go through a router. In order to set the tags, each of the specified routers had 2 interfaces which contains L2.10 and L2.20 to specify the tag that had to be attached for packets flowing through them. But since no default route has to be implemented, some students simply chose to leave empty the interface corresponding to this route. This explains the L2 case. \n",

    "We can thus see that specifying the argument `nodes` with a string representing the focus node limit our analysis to this particular router. The results then give a clear conclusion to this problem: the student defined GENE as its interface which should have been named port_GENE. Indeed, when we check the configuration files of this student, we see two times the same address both for different interface names. This leads to a problem with batfish which wasn't able to understand this fact. Instead, our software decided to consider only the first one to be the correct one leaving the second empty. While not creating big problem here (the interfaces used will be the ones without port inside their name), this could have been helpful for the student while he/she was configuring his/her network. We understand that he/she first defined the incorrect interfaces after switching to the correct ones without deleting the faulting elements. If a feedback given by batfish could have been make earlier, he/she could have been alerted of such a problem quicker."

Indeed, our overview of the batfish possibilities is limited to our network but also by the constraint this project involved. If we had more time, we could explore more in details some additional information we could inject inside our snapshot. The bandwidth parameter is one of them. By using what's called `runtime interface information` we could add everything scenarios on the links composing the infrastructure. The main purpose of these files (documented here: https://batfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html#runtime-interface-information) is to add this bandwidth information, as well as deciding which link between interfaces has failed or simply what is the delay for transmitting packets over a connection. This could be use for further testing of our network like verifying that the students correctly configured their AS to be sure that a failure doesn't lead to a complete fault inside other ASes or simply if the student put the correct costs on the interfaces if this was part of the project. Since this wasn't the case here, we decided only to introduce the concept by this little overview of such additional files."

Having unused structures doesn't lead to a problem like the one mentioned above but could be as much critical. When a router lacks of memory space, most of the time, it fails and simply reboots. This could create infinite loop where a router will be again completely full after its restart and then failing again. So we have to limit the cases where such problem could arise. Limiting the structures we use to the minimal required is part of the solution. Moreover, this leads to better maintaining of the nodes."

So the interpretation of the previous result is quite easier to get since we don't have to delve inside the configuration the student done. Indeed, the main reason of these entries is a lack of perfect cleaning of our configurations. The student was testing a lot of stuff to make its configuration works and this leads to an interesting number of structures that were like a one-shot for a test. Now, he could collect this feedback on its routers, he just wants to go back in time to avoid having such a mess inside his files.\n",

If we go back on our previous table listing these warnings, we could see these problems were located at the lines 83 and 87 of the \"LUGA\" router. But these lines are also part of the above dataframe. The entries number 1 and 2 cover these lines. So a solution have been found, the structures the student didn't define are used inside structures he did not exploit which don't lead to an error. So, he does some cleaning, but not carefully enough as we can see.\n",

    "Interestingly, it seems that batfish mislabeled some of the entries in the dataframe. You can clearly see that some IPs that are not part of AS 27 are being accessed via the ospf protocol.

This problem might be explained by the way our files were parsed. Indeed, in most of the examples provided by the batfish developpers, the files used are cisco configuration files. In our case, we converted frrouting files to a cumulus format so batfish can read them. This bug might be a side effect of this conversion.\n",

This problem arose also when we want to compare the loopback addresses with the used address for iBGP. The interface field inside the [iface_prop] is an inner batfish object while the addresses in the BGP frames were represented as a string.

Then since each router name is related to a type of economical relationship. `MILA` and `LYON` are connected to external customers, `MUNI` and `BASE` to providers and `LUGA` to peers.

We take this approach because we are sure of the current routers connected to external links, and we are sure about the role they have.

When we want to compute and verify policies rules, we are forced to use the correct route with all the parameters fixed by ourselves. Testing route policies doesn't do a kind of traceroute to apply all the modifications on the advertisements, we have to be aware of the format our route will have in order to correctly verify its communication to the other ASes.

But, after a tedious work on this possibility and a search on the issues page of batfish, we saw that this type of analysis would be completely unfeasible in the case of our network. Indeed, we would have used the `searchRoutePolicies` question for this purpose but this function is relatively new and the batfish documentation says itself that it could possibly fail. Furthermore, some issues are opened on the problem of eBgp not being advertised over iBgp leading to problem for getting all the policies. Finally, since the routes have to be defined exactly to be processed, including the exact AS path (the regex argument for using AS path fails nearly everytime), we cannot easily, in an autonomous fashion, see if the \"economical\" relationship of advertisement are strictly respected.\n",

Our result is completely biased and nothing is really worth keeping for a further analysis or even a grading of the students.
